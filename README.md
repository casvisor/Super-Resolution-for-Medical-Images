# Super Resolution for Medical Images ☠️
> #### _Archit | Spring '23 | Duke AIPI 540 Final Project_
&nbsp;


## Project Description ⭐  
The `Aim` of this project is to train and understand the working of SRGAN and Swift-SRGAN models on my proposed dataset of Chest X-rays. I will be downscaling high quality images from the dataset to generate low-resolution images (256x256). Then the generator will train to produce high-quality upscaled images (1024x1024), and these generated images will be compared against the original ground truths by the discriminator.

You can find the detailed project implementation and description on the [`main`](https://github.com/architkaila/Super-Resolution-for-Medical-Images) branch

## Running the demo (StreamLit App) 🧪  
The Streamlit-based web application is hosted live and can be accessed [here](https://image-super-resolution.streamlit.app/?page=Home)  

**1. Clone this repository and switch to the streamlit-demo branch**
```
git clone https://github.com/architkaila/Super-Resolution-for-Medical-Images
git checkout streamlit-demo
```
**2. Create a conda environment:** 
```
conda create --name st_demo python=3.9.16
conda activate st_demo
```
**3. Install requirements:** 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**4. Run the application**
```
streamlit run streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```
**5. StreamLit Appication:**  
* Here you can play around with the streamlit demo
